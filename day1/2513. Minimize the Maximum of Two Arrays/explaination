we are going to use binary search

x --> is the count of numbers from low to mid which are not divisible by d1
y --> is the count of numbers from low to mid which are not divisible by d2
z-> is the count of number which is not divisible by d1 and d2 , since when we subtract 

z = mid - (mid/d1)-(mid/d2)-; it'll substracts the number two times , so by doind this we subtract the same number by 2 times
 instead of that 
 z=mid-(mid/lcm);
